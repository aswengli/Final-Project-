# Final-Project
Problem Statement
# Biological Question
Does Pseudomonas aeruginosa contain genes associated with antibiotic resistance?
# Hypothesis
The bacterial genome contains genes that show significant similarity to known antibiotic resistance genes, indicating potential resistance to specific antibiotics.
# Significance
Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is essential for public health, as resistant bacteria pose significant challenges to treatment. Identifying resistance genes helps in monitoring the spread of resistance and developing strategies for antibiotic stewardship.
# Goal
Determine whether Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbors genes homologous to known antibiotic resistance genes and assess their potential impact on resistance phenotypes.
